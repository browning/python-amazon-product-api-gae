This is a minor fork of the python-amazon-product api located at:

http://bitbucket.org/basti/python-amazon-product-api/wiki/Home

That library uses lxml which is disallowed by google app engine.
This fork replaces lxml with BeautifulSoup.
If you are not on GAE you should use the original at the url above.

TODO:
    - add error handling like lxml python-amazon-product-api has
    - add friendlier property calls instead of just returning the parse tree
